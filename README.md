This Tableau project includes two interactive dashboards: Customer Dashboard and Sales Dashboard, designed for seamless navigation with a single button click. The Sales Dashboard presents key performance metrics, including sales and profit comparisons between the selected year and the previous year. It also highlights category-level performance with clear visualizations to identify potential areas of concern. The Customer Dashboard focuses on customer insights, showcasing key metrics such as total customers and total orders, along with a list of top customers. A dedicated filter section allows users to apply custom filters, dynamically updating all visualizations for a more interactive and insightful analysis.
